# How I chose a topic for my bachelor's thesis

I knew from the beginning that I wanted to draw illustrations. But I didn't have a specific text or genre of the book selected. The Reading on the Train Festival helped me find a real writer. I just went up to the writer at the festival and asked him if he didn’t mind giving me his unpublished text and he agreed. It was a surprise for me that such a famous writer and so easily agreed to help me. Miracles happen.
