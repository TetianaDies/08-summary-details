# How I chose a topic for my bachelor's thesis

I knew from the beginning that I wanted to draw illustrations. But I didn't have a specific text or genre of the book selected. The Reading on the Train Festival helped me find a real writer. I just went up to the writer at the festival and asked him if he didn’t mind giving me his unpublished text and he agreed. It was a surprise for me that such a famous writer and so easily agreed to help me. Miracles happen.

# A detective story

As we agreed, I received a small text that was written in the form of emails. The text provided contains a detective story for teenage girls with a touch of humor. The main plot in the book revolves around Amonita, she is an introvert. The story of the main character touches on the topic of cyberbullying on the Internet, the anonymity of users on social networks and the current problems of the young generation. The title of the book and the short story is "Pogo of angels at the tip of a needle", which symbolizes the risky behavior of young people, a kind of walking on thin ice.

# Inspiration first

I was mainly inspired by Lois van Baarle. She is a digital artist and character designer from Netherlands, mostly used purple in the illustrations and it looks like new and modern drawing technique. The main character she draws is a girl it inspired me, because in the book that I make, the main heroine is a young girl. When I was thinking about which drawing technique to choose, I noticed that the combination of real photography with vector graphics or a collage is very popular on social networks. In the end, I tried to combine photo and vector, which allowed me to create authorial illustrations.

# Illustration - first try
The hardest part is starting to draw, because the first illustration determines what the other pages will look like. During the creation of the first illustration, I rehearsed as the main heroine will look. Whether her face will be hidden or revealed on the first page. In the end, we chose the last variant.
