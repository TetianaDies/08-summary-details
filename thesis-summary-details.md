# How I chose a topic for my bachelor's thesis
      
I knew from the beginning that I wanted to draw illustrations. But I didn't have a specific text or genre of the book selected. The Reading on the Train Festival helped me find a real writer. I just went up to the writer at the festival and asked him if he didn’t mind giving me his unpublished text and he agreed. It was a surprise for me that such a famous writer and so easily agreed to help me. Miracles happen.

# A detective story

As we agreed, I received a small text that was written in the form of emails. The text provided contains a detective story for teenage girls with a touch of humor. The main plot in the book revolves around Amonita, she is an introvert. The story of the main character touches on the topic of cyberbullying on the Internet, the anonymity of users on social networks and the current problems of the young generation. The title of the book and the short story is "Pogo of angels at the tip of a needle", which symbolizes the risky behavior of young people, a kind of walking on thin ice.

# Inspiration first

I was mainly inspired by Lois van Baarle. She is a digital artist and character designer from Netherlands, mostly used purple in the illustrations and it looks like new and modern drawing technique. The main character she draws is a girl it inspired me, because in the book that I make, the main heroine is a young girl. When I was thinking about which drawing technique to choose, I noticed that the combination of real photography with vector graphics or a collage is very popular on social networks. In the end, I tried to combine photo and vector, which allowed me to create authorial illustrations.

# Illustration - first try
The hardest part is starting to draw, because the first illustration determines what the other pages will look like. During the creation of the first illustration, I rehearsed as the main heroine will look. Whether her face will be hidden or revealed on the first page. In the end, we chose the last variant.

# Illustration 
To illustrate the story, I chose a mixed style of photo collage and vector graphics. This mix of techniques also connects the main point in the book that the real world and contemporary life have largely moved into the virtual world and people live in a similar way as in a fictional world. Typography in typesetting is supported by emoticons that suggest and illustrate the narrator's mood. The beginning of each e-mail is taken into account in the text for better orientation in the text, and the avatar next to each e-mail also helps to visually distinguish the main characters in the book. I chose four main illustrations for the example, because there are 12 of them in total.

# Book cover
The cover of the book depicts the shadow of the main character, on whom she cries with emoticons, which symbolizes cyberbullying. As you can see in the picture, the cover had many variants, it took a long time to choose the font and background and other details.

The cover was originally yellow-blue because the writer liked this choice of color. But after all the illustrations were drawn, the color changed to purple. At the moment this is the final version.

# Edition

The story does not end with one book, so I designed other covers for a possible continuation of the story of Ammonita.
